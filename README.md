Description
-----

This software allows to control the flow of planes at an airport.
Several airports can be instantiated and managed separately.
The entire code has been tested (100% coverage).
Code and spec files are readable and it's easy to understand the main features.

Areas of improvement
-----

I want to keep on working on this software because there are several areas I would like to improve. In particular:
* forecast method shouldn't be part of the main class Airport but it should be part of a specific Class Weather;
* Airport class should be able to allow multiple planes to land and take_off at the same time
* I am sure there are other 10000 useful changes I might do so... stay tuned! :)
